            <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <p>
            E-Sports also known as electronic sports is a form of competition using video games. <br> Although organized online and offline competitions have long been a part of video game culture,
            the professional E-sports scene started around the early 2000s. <br>
            By the 2010s, e-sports has become a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing toward a professional esports subculture. <br>
            We decided to base our website around E-Sports because we both love video games. Especially competitive games like League of Legends and Counter Strike are our favourites.
