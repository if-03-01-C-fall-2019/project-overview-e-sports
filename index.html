            the professional E-sports scene started around the early 2000s. <br>
            By the 2010s, e-sports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing toward a professional esports subculture. <br>
            We decided to base out website around E-Sports because we bot love video games. Especially competitive games like League of Legends and Counter Strike are our favourites.
