                        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a First-person shooter. The games consists of several different game modes. But the the main game mode is the Competitive Mode.
                        In Competitive Mode two teams consisting of 5 players compete against each other. In this game mode teamplay and skill is very important. The teams are called Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists (which are abbreviated as Ts and
                        CTs).
                        There are many different weapon categories in the game. The are Pistols, Heavys, SMGs, Rifles and grenades.
                        Both teams can buy the same weapons except for some exceptions. For example the Ts can buy a AK-47 which the CTs can't but the CT counterpart is the M4A4/M4A1S.
                        The game is divided in rounds which are about 2 minutes long.There are 30 rounds in total an to win the match 1 team needs to win 16 rounds. If both teams win 15 rounds the match ends in a draw.
                        A very important feature in CS:GO is the economic system. In round 1 both start with 800$ to buy pistols. In the following rounds the winner team gets Money to buy better guns and other equipment, but the losing team
                        also gets a losing bonus which is obviously less than the money you get for winning. But if one team is losing several rounds in a row the losing bonus increases.
                        After losing 5 rounds or more the losing bonus is the same as the money you get for winning, which creates chances for a comeback for the losing team. So it is very impportant as a team to think
                        about how you spend your money.
